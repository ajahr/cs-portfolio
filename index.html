                <p>My name is Aja, aka macaronimuchacha. I am a high school student that attends a charter school in California, where I take
                a UC approved Intro to Computer Science Course. This class teaches the basics of CSS, HTML, and some JavaScript.
                Slowly but surely, I found myself becoming invested in webpage design and making small websites that looked nice.</p>
            </div>
        
            <p class=basicinfo>If you're wondering about the name, I really like macaroni and am a young girl, so chose to represent myself with 
            "macaroni muchacha." It also matches my friend, Kayla, aka <a class="link" href="http://tinyurl.com/mochimumu"> <strong>mochimuchacha
            <strong></a>. </p>
            
            <p class=basicinfo>This is the home page of a website that's about me and my endeavors. You can click the links at the top in the nav bar to explore.</p>
            
            <h2 class=heading> General Skills I've Learned </h2>
            
            <p class=basicinfo> Through this class, I learned the imprortance of perseverance, research, and precision. While an issue might seem impossible
            to solve at first, I had to research and keep trying until I cracked it. The other incredibly important part of coding was precision. One tiny
            mistake like forgetting to close one tag would throw off the entire project. </p>
            
            <h2 class=heading> Computer Science Exploration</h2>
            
            <p class=basicinfo>The computer science class I'm taking is a UC approved course that introduces concepts like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            At the beginning, I was hesitant to take this course, because I had been introduced to code before and didn't like it. I also had far
            fewer skills, as shown by the first website I ever made on the left.</p>

            <p> In just one week, I've learned how to 
            
                <ul> 
                    <li>Make headers and change their size and colors</li>
                    <li>Add paragraphs</li>
                    <li>Add navbars to pages</li>
                    <li>Add backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Use "div" commands to format pages</li>
                    <li>Use colors and fonts</li>
                    <li>Add images</li>
                    <li>And much more!</li>
