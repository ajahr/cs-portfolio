      <h2 class=heading>What Did You Create?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>I created a program that uses functions, for loops, conditionals, arrays, and basic shapes to create turtles
                at the location of the mouse when clicked in a pond setting. This is also known as generative art. Generatve art is art 
                that has been at least partially created by an autonomous system (in this case, a computer). For my generative art, I chose to 
                make a pond scene, simply because turtles are one of my favorite animals.</p>
            <h2 class=heading>How Does the Project Work Overall?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo> The lily pads are created with arrays and animated with for loops. The turtles are created by a function 
                that is called within a mouseClicked function. Then the location of the turtle is stored within an array and looped through a 
                for loop, constantly redrawing it over the background. Both the lilypads and turtles are created with simple shapes. </p>
            <h2 class=heading>What are Some Specifics of the Code?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>My generative art uses Javascript. More specifically, it uses conditionals, for loops, functions, and arrays.
                </p>
                <h3 class=smallheading>Conditionals</h3>
                    <div class=container>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu14" style="width:120px;vertical-align:35px"/>
                        <p style="width:300px">Conditionals are used in <strong>if</strong> loops to determine whether or not a conditional is 
                        true and then run a codeblock. If the conditional is true, then it will run; if not, nothing will happen. If you'd like 
                        to run a different codeblock when the conditional is false, you add an <strong>else</strong> loop at the end. For 
                        example, on the left, if any random number between 0 and 5 is greater than 4, then 
                        the program will draw a circle at the top left corner. If the number isn't bigger
                        than four, then it will draw a circle near the center left of the canvas. </p>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu15" style="width:105px;vertical-align:35px" />
                    </div>
                    <p class=basicinfo>In my project specifically, the conditional in my if statement controls how often a new lilypad is generated.
                    In fact, it follows the format of the example pretty closely. If a number between 0 and 100 was greater than 99, then it 
                    would generate a new lilypad.</p>  
                    
                <h3 class=smallheading>For Loops</h3>
                  <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu17" style="width:225px;padding-left:87.5px" />
                  <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu16" style="width:100px" />
                  <p class=basicinfo>For loops are used to constantly loop through a certain codeblock. The <strong>initiator,</strong> or the first part of the 
                  for loop, starts the for loop and declares and assigns a value to a variable. The second part of the for loop, the 
                  <strong>conditional</strong>, is used just like the conditionals in if statements: as long as the conditional is true, then the 
                  codeblock inside the curly brackets will run. Finally, the <strong>increment</strong>, or the last part of the for loop, increases 
                  or decreases the variable. The example here shows two for loops drawing an animation of circles. The initiator in the first for loop 
                  sets the variable in charge of the x position at 0. Then, in the conditional, it runs the second for loop as long as i is less than 0.
                  Finally, it increases by the maximum radius (30) each time. In the second for loop, a similar format is followed. However, in the
                  codeblock, there is an ellipse method that draws an ellipse using i as x and j as y. It also changes the fill of each circle to a 
                  different shade of blue. In my generative art's code, for loops were used to redraw the turtle in the same spot over the background: the
                  initiator, conditional, and increment followed the format that is used by any for loop that loops through an array (initiator is i=0, 
                the conditional is i&lt;array.length, and the incremement is i++.</p>
                    
                <h3 class=smallheading>Functions</h3>
                  <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu19" style="width:150px;padding-left:50px" />
                  <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu18" style="width:300px" />
                  <p class=basicinfo>Functions are used to run a codeblock when called. Creating a function is simple: you just write <strong>
                  function</strong> followed by the name you want it to have. The parentheses contain the arguments used to call the functions. 
                  In this example, a prototype of my turtle generative art, the code block draws a turtle when called. It uses mouseX and 
                  mouseY as the arguments and is called when the mouse is clicked. This means it draws a turtle wherever the mouse is when it's
                  clicked.</p>
                    
                <h3 class=smallheading>Arrays</h3>
                    <p class=basicinfo>Arrays are variables that are created like so:</p>
                    <div style="text-align:center"> <strong>var myArray= []</strong></div>
                    <p class=basicinfo>Deceptively simple looking, they are used to create and store multiple variables at once. In the context of
                    my generative art, I used them to generate lily pads and store the locations of my turtles.  Using the <strong>.push</strong>
                  method, you can create a new object to be stored in the array. In the case of my turtles, I pushed the location of the mouseX 
                  and mouseY. For my lilypads, I pushed a random number between 400 and 500 for the x-value of my lilypads and any number between
                  0 and 500 for the y-value of my lilypads. Once you have your variable values, you can use them to draw and call methods with, as I did. </p>
                
            <h2 class=heading>What Choices Were Made?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>Basically, I decided what to make and how to make it. I chose to make a program that made turtles
                when and wherever the mouse was clicked. Then I decided I wanted to go the extra mile and make the background an animation
                that illustrated lilypads moving down a stream. After this decision, I realized that I would have to use arrays. 
                </p>
                <h3 class=smallheading>Why Were These Choices Made?</h3>
                <p class=basicinfo>Each choice made had the intention of bringing it closer to a program that was visually appealing
                and centered around turtles (because I really like turtles). When I decided I wanted to have the background be lilypads,
                I had to choose between having an animated but difficult background, or a stationary but easier background. Eventually, I 
                decided to go with animated because I wanted to challenge myself. 
                </p>
            <h2 class=heading>What is One Thing I Will Remember?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>I'll (hopefully) remember arrays because they took so much work and were so difficult to understand. 
                They also opened up a lot of possibilities and allow me to animate things now, so they're very useful.
                </p>
