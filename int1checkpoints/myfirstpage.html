     <h1>Porkle the Chicken Chorkle</h1>
         <p> Porkle was a Chicken Chorkle.<br>
         His name caused some confusion. <br>
         Is he a piggy plorkle? <br>
         A weird chick-pig fusion? <br>
         But he was an ordinary chicken, <br>
         Who just wanted some friends. <br>
         So he made himself quite popular, <br>
         Among the lady hens!
