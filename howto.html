            <h2 class=heading>What Did You Create?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>I created a webpage that tries to encapsulate all the HTML and CSS I learned in the past week and a half. It 
                uses the new techniques we learned for formatting. When making our webpages, we were supposed to make exuctive desicions 
                concerning style, color scheme, and organization that showcased what he had learned. This project would assess our skills of 
                multimedia in presentation, precision, and explanation. </p>
            <h2 class=heading>How Does the Project Work Overall?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>The project uses HTML and CSS: the HTML is the skeleton of the project, and CSS fleshes it out. This website 
                has a navbar at the top that is used for navigation. The page is organized by headings, and paragraphs give the basic information.
                Images add interest to the site, and lists organize specifics into an easy to read format.</p>
            <h2 class=heading>What are Some Specifics of the Code?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>I'll introduce some parts of the code that will give you enough to make your own barebones website. It won't 
                be anything fancy, but it will be easy to understand. </p>
                <h3 class=smallheading>Headings</h3>
                    <div class=container>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu9" style="width:120px" />
                        <p style="width:310px">Headings add structure to your webpage. All the big text and titles? Those are headings, made by 
                        heading tags that look like this: &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;. There's also an example image on the left. The number in the 
                        &lt;h1&gt; impacts the szie of the heading. An example os this is shown on the right. In fact, the code in the image on 
                        the left results in the HTML on the right. The rest of the specifics of the code used to make this webpage will follow 
                        this format.</p>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu7" style="width:100px" />
                    </div>
                        
                <h3 class=smallheading>Paragraphs</h3>
                    <div class=container>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu10" style="width:120px" />
                        <p style="width:310px">Paragraphs contain all the main blocks of information. In fact, the words you're reading right now
                        are part of a pragraph. In HTML, there's a special tag for this: the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tag. This tag is super important 
                        for writing pretty much anything on your webpage, and basically filling out a webpage with content. To make a paragraph, 
                        make the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags, and write whatever the content is between them. </p>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu11" style="width:100px" />
                    </div>
                    
                <h3 class=smallheading>Images</h3>
                    <div class=container>
                        <img src="http://tinyurl.com/macaronimumu12" style="width:120px" />
                        <p style="width:310px">Images are important to making your website and webpage visually appealing. These are added with 
                        the &lt;img&gt; tag. This tag is a little different from the others. You may notice that there's no end tag: this is 
                        because the content is within the tag itself, not between the two of them. The image is generated with the "src" part, 
                        as shown in the image on the left, where it references the url of the image. If you want to resize it, you can put a 
                        "stlye={width or height}" in the tag.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                
            <h2 class=heading>What Choices Were Made?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>There are many choices involved in making a visually appealing website. On top of all the basic info above, you
                    need to decide on a background, color scheme, font, type of layout, where you place borders, where you place and your
                    organization system. For me, I decided I wanted a blue color scheme. That meant that I was going to find a simple but attractive
                    blue background to start with. Once I had that down, I knew I'd need to be able to read the text, so I made a scrolling semi-
                    opaque background for the text. I inserted stragetically-placed images to add interest to the site, and divided seperate ideas 
                    with lines on the sides of the headings. 
                </p>
                <h3 class=smallheading>Why Were These Choices Made?</h3>
                <p class=basicinfo>The choices made had the end goal of making a cohesive, visually appealing website. This meant all the elements 
                    looked like they were part of something bigger (a normal viewer would not be able to pick out an element and be utterly certain 
                    it was its own element, and not part of a different one). For example, all of the elements use the same color scheme: blues and
                    whites. The font is the same across the website: garamond, not the default times new roman, as it fits the overall aesthetic. 
                    Choices like this were made to add to the overall look of the website.
                </p>
            <h2 class=heading>What is One Thing I Will Remember?</h2>
                <p class=basicinfo>Overall, the skill of basic coding is something important to know and remember in the 21st century. I know for 
                sure I'll remember the basics like headings, paragraphs, images, and divs. I'll also try and remeber how to create and structure a 
                navbar, as it is an extremely useful tool. I'll also remember more generally applicable skills like pererverance, precision, and 
                time management.
